									<p>My time at the University of the West of Scotland gave me a deep understanding in what it means to work in Computing Science. The teamwork required, the vast set of skills you must dip into, and the passion you have to hone and work at it for years not just before and after university, but during too. My first two years at UWS was much more noticeably 'easier' than my latter years, these years were most certainly used for settling me into the University mindset and for being such a young university, I was given good advice and guidance when required, as well as given a clear understanding of how the universities systems worked. </p>
									<p>I developed a deep understanding of developing various applications in a myraid of programming languages such as Java, C++, Rust, Python, and C#. Given a really in-depth knowledge of 'exotic' systems to layman such as unix based layouts. I truly had no idea how Linux and its distributions worked, and honestly the prospect of learning something as complicated as Linux can be was daunting. But under the tutelage of the lecturers here at UWS, I now run my own media/game server in pure Debian built from the ground up. Once they had instilled the core of how the operating system works, it really became clear. Amongst other teachings, I learned how various functions of computers work not limited to operating systems, but how various data systems and memory structures operate at the kernel level. </p>
									<p>During my penultimate year at UWS, I continued developing a passion project known as Valorant Lineups I had developed a front-end prototype the year before for. The staff at UWS had no issues with this and encouraged me to push forward with this idea and formalise it into a fully realised web application. Under the supervision of a lecturer who had judged me at a student competition for the National Air Traffic Service, I was able to complete a prototype for, and still am developing Valorant Lineups. My time at the University of the West of Scotland has made me keenly interested in studying a masters related to Computing, or diversifying and studying a completely new field entirely. I had my initial doubts and nerves about university, but UWS showed me that furthering your education formally is never a bad thing. Especially when funded by the Scottish Government!</p>
