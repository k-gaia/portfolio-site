									<h1>Projects</h1>

								<p>I'm not afraid to have a crack at something I've never done before, I think its more fun that way! Especially when there are numerous things to consider in which I've never done at all, I love getting my foot in the door for projects and branching out into bigger and better things from there. I love DIY, Cooking, Media creation, Gardening. You name it I've probably at least looked into it.</p>

								<h3>Valorant Lineups</h3>
								</header>
								<p>In late 2019, after the announcement of Valorant Lineups by Riot Games. I had thought about the importance of third-party community created applications that were instrumental in learning my experience in Counter-Strike Global-Offensive. Without these expertly created community driven tools I wouldn't be anywhere near as proficient in the tactical shooter as I am today. I wanted to be able to allow other players of Valorant, have the same experiences I had in learning the game. However, many sites that offer strategies or 'tips'. Are very heavily curated and are often not community-driven. Thus, Valorant Lineups was born.</p>

									<h3>Valorant Datamining</h3>
								</header>
								<p>In order to aquire resources for my web app 'Valorant Lineups', I had to procure sound files from the game itself. Since then I've been looking at various ways in extracting these files from the game. Various avenues exist in the aims to extract the .pak files Unreal uses as compression methods for games designed in their engine. <a href="https://github.com/iAmAsval/FModel" target="_blank">FModel</a> is a very simple and deep tooling which allows effective data-mining of any Unreal based game. Using this I've created Python scripts to read the JSON architecture. This process was simple to write in Python and distribute online via YouTube guide and Google Drive.</p>

									<h3>A Game of NATS</h3>
								</header>
								<p>During my second year at the University of the West of Scotland, we were all presented as computing students a chance to enter the competition presented to us by the National Air Traffic Service. We had two weeks to envision a game which educated interested individuals about air traffic controls. Any approach was encouraged, blue sky thinking, basic design documentation, or full blown development. I decided to fully develop a prototype game within the two week timeframe, and won a prize for it!</p>

									<h3>Sunstone - A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moonstone:_A_Hard_Days_Knight" target="_blank">Moonstone</a> Homage</h3>
								</header>
								<p>Absolutely fascinated by the games my father adored as he was growing up, one always stood out to me and reminded me of Dark Souls mixed with, old school amiga-like gameplay. I've had an idea to recreate its mechanics and intricacies for local co-op play for a long time. I've created various systems in Unity to emulate its gameplay loops and one day will finish my homage. </p>
